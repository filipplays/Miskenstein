# Miskenstein

This is my contribution for the iSYSTEM iZZIV student competition. iSYSTEM iZZIV is a competition for students organized by iSYTEM Labs, where students can improve their programming and electrical engineering knowledge and win prizes. The asignment was to make a game for an embedded system named Miško3. Miško3 is a learning platform created by a student at the Faculty of electrical engineering in Ljubljana. You can find its github page here: https://github.com/mjankovec/MiSKo3.

My game is a Doom 3D clone. The goal is to naviagate a randomly generated map and kill all of the enemies as fast as possible.
